A couple of years ago, a new phenomenon appeared in the Front-end world: the Jamstack. For people unknown to this way of developing, it might sound like some sticky sandwiches piled on top of each other. But actually it is a fantastic way to build Front-end applications.

# What is a Jamstack?

The "Jam" part in Jamstack is an acronym that stands for:

* "JavaScript": for the interactivity and the logic of application
* "API's": which is an acronym in itself (Application Programming Interface). API's enable communication with external systems or services
* "Markup": The last part stands for Markup. This is used for templating out the scaffolding of a page. With Jamstack pages are often empty until filled through JavaScript and content from API's

All of this enables a Front-end developer to build sites and application in a relative short time. Which is awesome!

I'll explain by showing a couple of models:

![A model comparing a regular web stack and a Jamstack](https://www.sharevalue.nl/images/sharevalue/blogs/schema_JAMstack.png "A regular web stack in comparison to a Jamstack")

As shown in the model, it clear to see that the jamstack is shorter that a traditional stack. This is mainly caused by moving parts to remote alternatives, and consumed through multiple API calls. So instead of one back-end, you have many systems through SaaS solutions.

## So multiple connections are faster than one traditional architecture?

Yes, there is a difference between load time on rendering and on compiling:

Because all parts are generated separately before being served through a CDN, the render-time will result in a quicker loading site.

## Demo time: JAMdemo

To demonstrate te use of the Jamstack, I made a fun demo with Gatsby (a static-site generator based on React). For the API part i chose Sanity. As a CDN I used Netlify.

### The J of JavaScript

Gatsby is a great way to build static sites and applications. Because it is based on React, developers can start easily because of the popularity of React.

### The A of API's

All the content is written and maintained in Sanity; a headless CMS that can be customised to whats needed.

### The M of Markup

The Markup in my demo is set up in Gatsby as well. Here you can build you templates that will be populated with content out of Sanity

## Version control and Continuous Deployment

Of course we use Git for version control. In this case it is a public repo: [https://github.com/johanbijlsma/JAMdemo](https://github.com/johanbijlsma/JAMdemo "https://github.com/johanbijlsma/JAMdemo"). Everytime a commit is pushed, the project is build and deployed by Netlify. This last is called Continuous Deployment.

The Demo can be found here: [https://jams-jams-jams.netlify.com/](https://jams-jams-jams.netlify.com/ "https://jams-jams-jams.netlify.com/")

## To conclude

The Jamstack has a lot to offer. Because of the short Time-to-market an by combining external services, it is a great opportunity for development teams with no Back-end capacity in-house. I can say that I really love building sites with the Jamstack methodology, and since I discovered Netlify as a hosting party, I went all in. They are primary way to host my sites an applications.
